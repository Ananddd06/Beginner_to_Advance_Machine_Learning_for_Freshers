# 📊 Understanding Correlation and Its Types

## 🔍 What is Correlation?

Correlation is a **statistical measure** that describes the **relationship between two variables**. It determines how one variable **moves in relation to another**.

### ✅ Types of Correlation

1. **Positive Correlation** (📈): As one variable **increases**, the other also **increases**.
2. **Negative Correlation** (📉): As one variable **increases**, the other **decreases**.
3. **No Correlation** (⚖️): No relationship between the two variables.

## 🔢 Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)

**Pearson correlation** measures the **linear** relationship between two continuous variables.

### 🏗️ Formula:

```text
{\displaystyle \rho _{X,Y}={\frac {\operatorname {cov} (X,Y)}{\sigma _{X}\sigma _{Y}}}}
```

### 📝 Pearson Correlation (Without Built-in Functions)

```python
import numpy as np

def pearson_correlation(X, Y):
    n = len(X)

    # Calculate means
    mean_x = sum(X) / n
    mean_y = sum(Y) / n

    # Compute numerator and denominator
    numerator = sum((X[i] - mean_x) * (Y[i] - mean_y) for i in range(n))
    denominator = np.sqrt(sum((X[i] - mean_x)**2 for i in range(n))) * np.sqrt(sum((Y[i] - mean_y)**2 for i in range(n)))

    return numerator / denominator

# Example
X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Y = [2, 4, 5, 4, 6]

print(f"Pearson Correlation: {pearson_correlation(X, Y):.4f}")
```

### ✅ Advantages:

- Works well for **linear relationships**.
- Fast to compute.

### ❌ Disadvantages:

- **Sensitive to outliers**.
- Only works well for **linear** relationships.

## 🔢 Spearman Rank Correlation (rₛ)

**Spearman correlation** measures the **monotonic** relationship between two variables. It is used when the data is **not linearly related** but still follows an increasing/decreasing trend.

### 🏗️ Formula:

```text

\rho=1-\frac{6 \sum d_{i}^{2}}{n (n^{2}-1)}
\rho	=	Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
d_{i}	=	difference between the two ranks of each observation
n	=	number of observations

```

### PYTHON CODE

```python
def rank_array(arr):
    """Assign ranks to elements in an array."""
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(arr)
    ranks = np.empty_like(sorted_indices, dtype=float)
    ranks[sorted_indices] = np.arange(1, len(arr) + 1)
    return ranks

def spearman_rank_correlation(X, Y):
    n = len(X)

    # Compute ranks
    rank_X = rank_array(X)
    rank_Y = rank_array(Y)

    # Compute rank differences
    d = rank_X - rank_Y
    d_squared = np.sum(d**2)

    # Apply Spearman's formula
    spearman_corr = 1 - (6 * d_squared) / (n * (n**2 - 1))

    return spearman_corr

# Example
X = [3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
Y = [85, 70, 95, 80, 99]

print(f"Spearman Rank Correlation: {spearman_rank_correlation(X, Y):.4f}")

```

### ✅ Why Use Spearman Correlation?

Spearman correlation **solves Pearson’s weaknesses**:

- **Works for non-linear relationships**.
- **Less affected by outliers**.
- Useful for **ordinal data** (rankings, ratings).
