    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful open-source library in Python used for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multidimensional Arrays: A core feature of NumPy is its ndarray object, which represents a multidimensional array of elements of the same type, enabling efficient storage and manipulation of data.\n",
    "* Mathematical Functions: NumPy includes a comprehensive collection of mathematical functions for operations such as linear algebra, statistical analysis, Fourier transforms, and more.\n",
    "* Vectorized Operations: It allows for element-wise operations on arrays, reducing the need for explicit loops and optimizing performance.\n",
    "* Interoperability: It integrates well with other scientific libraries and is commonly used in combination with libraries like SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib."
