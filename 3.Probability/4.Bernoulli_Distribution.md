# 🎲 **Bernoulli Distribution - In Depth**

## 🔹 **Introduction**

The **Bernoulli distribution** is a **discrete probability distribution** that models a random experiment with **two possible outcomes**:  
✅ **Success (1)** with probability **p**  
❌ **Failure (0)** with probability **1 - p**.

It is typically used for **binary** outcomes, such as **coin flips** (heads/tails), **product reviews** (like/dislike), or other situations with **two outcomes**.

## 🎯 **1. Bernoulli Distribution PMF (Probability Mass Function)**

The **PMF** of the Bernoulli distribution is given by the formula:

$$
P(X = k) =
\\begin{cases}
p & \\text{for } k = 1 \\\\
1 - p & \\text{for } k = 0
\\end{cases}
$$

Where:

- **p** is the probability of success (1).
- **1 - p** is the probability of failure (0).

### 📌 **Example: Coin Flip (Success = Heads, Failure = Tails)**

- **p = 0.5** (for a fair coin).
- The possible outcomes are **0 (Tails)** and **1 (Heads)**.

---

## 🎯 **2. Bernoulli Distribution - Summation Formula**

To compute the **PMF** using summation, we use the formula:

$$
P(X = k) = p^k (1 - p)^{(1-k)} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1
$$

Where:

- \( k = 1 \) for success (1),
- \( k = 0 \) for failure (0).

This formula sums the probabilities for **k = 0 and k = 1**, and the total sum will always be **1**.

## 🎯 **3. Statistical Measures for Bernoulli Distribution**

### 📊 **Mean (Expected Value)**

The **mean** of a Bernoulli distribution is the probability of success:

$$
E[X] = p
$$

### 📊 **Variance**

The **variance** is calculated as:

$$
Var(X) = p(1 - p)
$$

### 📊 **Standard Deviation (Std)**

The **standard deviation** is the square root of the variance:

$$
\\text{Std}(X) = \\sqrt{p(1 - p)}
$$

### 📊 **Mode**

- The **mode** is the most frequent outcome.
- If **p > 0.5**, the mode is **1 (success)**.
- If **p < 0.5**, the mode is **0 (failure)**.
- If **p = 0.5**, both outcomes are equally likely.

### 📊 **Median**

- If **p = 0.5**, both **0** and **1** can be the median.
- Otherwise, the median is the value corresponding to **p**.

## 🎯 **4. Visualization Example with Python**

Below is the Python code using **NumPy** to generate a **Bernoulli distribution** and plot its **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example dataset (binary values)
data = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1])

# Compute probability p (mean of the dataset)
p = np.mean(data)

# Compute statistical measures
mean = p
variance = p * (1 - p)
mode = 1 if p > 0.5 else 0
median = 1 if p > 0.5 else (0 if p < 0.5 else "0 or 1")

# Print results
print(f"Mean (Expected Value): {mean}")
print(f"Variance: {variance}")
print(f"Mode: {mode}")
print(f"Median: {median}")


```
