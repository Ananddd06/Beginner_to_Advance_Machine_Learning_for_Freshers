# 🎲 **Probability Distribution Functions (PDF)**

## 🔹 **Introduction**

A **Probability Distribution** tells us **how probabilities are assigned to different outcomes** in a random experiment.

There are three main types of probability distributions:  
1️⃣ **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** - Used for **discrete** values (e.g., rolling a die 🎲).  
2️⃣ **Probability Density Function (PDF)** - Used for **continuous** values (e.g., height of people 📏).  
3️⃣ **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** - Represents the **total probability up to a certain point**.

## 🎯 **1. Probability Mass Function (PMF)**

PMF is used when outcomes are **discrete** (countable). It gives the probability of each specific outcome.

### 📌 **Example: Rolling a Die 🎲**

- Possible outcomes: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6**
- Each outcome has **equal probability**:

```text
Probability of rolling a 3 = 1 / 6 Probability of rolling a 5 = 1 / 6
```

📌 **Key Points About PMF:**  
✔ Used for countable outcomes (like dice, coin flips).  
✔ Each probability is a fixed value.  
✔ The **sum of all probabilities is always 1**.

## 🎯 **2. Probability Density Function (PDF)**

PDF is used when outcomes are **continuous** (infinite possible values). It tells **how dense the probability is** at each value.

### 📌 **Example: Heights of People 📏**

- Heights are continuous (e.g., **170.5 cm, 171.2 cm**).
- We cannot assign probability to a single height **exactly**, so we find probability **over a range**.

### ✅ **Understanding Area Under the Curve**

Since individual values in a continuous distribution have **zero probability**, we use **area under the curve** to find probabilities:

1️⃣ **Total Probability = 1**

- The entire area under the probability curve adds up to **1 (100%)**.

2️⃣ **Probability of a Range**

- If we want the probability of height **between 160 cm and 170 cm**, we calculate the area between those two points.

3️⃣ **Finding Probability Density (Using Slope Method)**

- To find how much probability is concentrated at a certain point, we calculate the **slope** at that point:

```text
Slope = (Probability at Height 2 - Probability at Height 1) ÷ (Height 2 - Height 1)
Slope = (x2 - x1)/(y2-y1) # Formula for finding  the slope Also know as the gradient
```

✔ **Steep slope** → High probability density.  
✔ **Flat slope** → Low probability density.  
✔ The **area under the curve** gives the **actual probability for a range of values**.

## 🎯 **3. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**

CDF gives the **total probability up to a certain point**. It helps answer questions like:

- **What is the probability of rolling ≤ 3 on a die?**
- **What is the probability of a person being ≤ 170 cm tall?**

### 📌 **Example: Rolling a Die 🎲**

If we roll a die, the CDF is:

```text
P(≤ 1) = 1/6 P(≤ 2) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 P(≤ 3) = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 P(≤ 4) = 3/6 + 1/6 = 4/6 P(≤ 5) = 4/6 + 1/6 = 5/6 P(≤ 6) = 5/6 + 1/6 = 1 (100%)
```

📌 **Key Points About CDF:**  
✔ Always **increases** (never decreases).  
✔ Final value is always **1 (100%)**.  
✔ Helps find the probability **up to a certain point**.

✔ **PMF** is for **discrete** values (e.g., dice, number of heads in coin tosses).  
✔ **PDF** is for **continuous** values (e.g., heights, weights).  
✔ **CDF** is the sum of probabilities up to a point.  
✔ The **area under the PDF curve** represents the probability for a **range of values**.
