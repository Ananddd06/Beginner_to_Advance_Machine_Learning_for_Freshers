# 📊 **Types of Probability Distribution Functions (PDF)**

## 🔹 **Introduction**

Probability distributions help us understand how the values of a random variable are spread out. There are two main types of probability distributions:

- **Discrete Distributions (PMF)** – For **countable** outcomes (e.g., number of heads in coin tosses).
- **Continuous Distributions (PDF)** – For outcomes that can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight).

## 🟢 **1. Discrete Probability Distributions (PMF)**

These distributions apply to **discrete** random variables, where the data can take a **countable** set of outcomes.

### 📍 **🔘 Bernoulli Distribution (Binary Outcomes)**

- **Definition**: Describes an experiment with two possible outcomes: **success** (1) or **failure** (0). It's a **binary distribution**.
- **Example**: Tossing a coin 🪙, where the outcome is either heads (success) or tails (failure).

### 📍 **🎲 Binomial Distribution (PMF for Multiple Trials)**

- **Definition**: Describes the number of **successes** in a fixed number of **independent trials**. Each trial has two possible outcomes (success or failure).
- **Example**: Tossing a coin 5 times and counting how many times you get heads.

### 📍 **⏱ Poisson Distribution (Events Over Time or Space)**

- **Definition**: Models the number of **events** occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, based on the average rate of occurrence.
- **Example**: The number of cars passing a checkpoint on a highway in one hour 🚗.

## 🔵 **2. Continuous Probability Distributions (PDF)**

These distributions apply to **continuous** random variables, where the data can take any value within a specified range.

### 📍 **🔔 Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)**

- **Definition**: The normal distribution is the most common continuous distribution and is represented by a **bell curve**. It describes data that is symmetrically distributed around the mean.
- **Example**: Heights of people 👤, exam scores 📑, or measurement errors.

### 📍 **📏 Standard Normal Distribution**

- **Definition**: A specific type of normal distribution where the mean is **0** and the standard deviation is **1**. It is used in **z-scores** and other standardization techniques.
- **Example**: Standardized test scores (e.g., SAT, GRE) where values are compared relative to the mean 🎓.

### 📍 **🎲 Uniform Distribution**

- **Definition**: In a uniform distribution, all outcomes are equally likely to occur. It is a **flat distribution** where every interval of the same length has the same probability.
- **Example**: Rolling a fair die 🎲 or selecting a random number between 1 and 10.

### 📍 **⏳ Exponential Distribution (Time Between Events)**

- **Definition**: The exponential distribution models the time between **events** in a **Poisson process**. It is often used to represent the waiting time between random events.
- **Example**: The time between arrivals of buses 🚌 or the time until the next phone call at a call center.

### 📍 **⏱ Gamma Distribution**

- **Definition**: The gamma distribution generalizes the exponential distribution to model the time until a given number of events occurs. It’s useful in **queueing theory** and **waiting times**.
- **Example**: The time until the third phone call arrives at a call center 📞.

### 📍 **📉 Log-Normal Distribution**

- **Definition**: The log-normal distribution describes a variable whose **logarithm** is normally distributed. It is often used for modeling **stock prices** and **financial data**.
- **Example**: The distribution of income 💸, stock prices 📈, or biological growth 🌱.

### 📍 **💹 Power Law Distribution**

- **Definition**: A power law distribution describes situations where **small occurrences are common**, but **large occurrences are rare**, following a **power law relationship**. It’s used to model phenomena with **heavy tails**.
- **Example**: The distribution of **wealth** in economies 💰, **city sizes** 🏙, or **word frequency** in language 🗣.

### 📍 **💸 Pareto Distribution**

- **Definition**: The Pareto distribution is a type of **power law distribution** that describes the **80/20 rule** – where a small percentage of the population accounts for most of the wealth or other resources.
- **Example**: The distribution of **wealth** in a society, where 20% of people hold 80% of the wealth.

## 🔶 **3. Mixed Distributions**

Mixed distributions combine both **discrete and continuous** elements. They are typically used when some parts of the problem involve discrete data and other parts involve continuous data.

- **Example**: A **truncated distribution**, where some values are **cut off** based on a specific threshold 🔲.

---

## 🔴 **4. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**

The **CDF** is not a distribution on its own but is used to describe the **accumulated probability**. It tells us the probability that a random variable is **less than or equal to a specific value**. It can be derived from any **PMF** or **PDF**.
