# ðŸŽ² **Poisson Distribution** - Understanding the Basics and Application

## ðŸ”¹ **Introduction to Poisson Distribution**

The **Poisson distribution** is a probability distribution that represents the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, where:

1. Events occur independently.
2. The average rate of occurrence (\( \lambda \)) is constant.

It is commonly used for **counting the number of events** that happen within a specific time period, such as the number of people entering a market, number of accidents at a traffic light, or the number of phone calls in a call center.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Poisson Distribution Formula**

The **Poisson probability mass function (PMF)** is given by:

$$
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

Where:

- \( P(X = k) \) is the probability of \( k \) events occurring.
- \( \lambda \) is the average rate of occurrence (mean number of events).
- \( e \) is Euler's number (approximately 2.718).
- \( k \) is the number of events (i.e., people visiting the market).

This formula is used to calculate the **probability** of exactly \( k \) events occurring within a fixed interval.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Mean and Variance of Poisson Distribution**

The mean and variance of a Poisson distribution are equal and both are given by \( \lambda \).

### ðŸ“ˆ **Mean Formula:**

$$
\text{Mean} = \lambda
$$

### ðŸ“‰ **Variance Formula:**

$$
\text{Variance} = \lambda
$$

The **standard deviation** (SD) is the square root of the variance:

$$
\text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\lambda}
$$

### ðŸŽ¯ **Median**:

For a Poisson distribution, the median doesn't have a simple closed formula. However, it is often approximated as the **integer part of** \( \lambda \) when \( \lambda \) is large.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Example: Number of People Visiting a Market**

Letâ€™s assume the **average number of people visiting the market** per hour is \( \lambda = 4 \). We are interested in finding the probability that **more than 5 people** will visit the market in an hour.

### **Poisson Distribution Calculation**:

We can calculate the probability using the Poisson formula for various values of \( k \) (the number of people). The **probability of more than 5 people** is:

$$
P(X > 5) = 1 - P(X \leq 5)
$$

Where \( P(X \leq 5) \) is the cumulative probability of having 5 or fewer people visit the market. We can calculate this using the PMF formula.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Python Code Implementation**

Below is the Python code that calculates the probability of more than 5 people visiting the market based on the Poisson distribution.

```python
import math

# Function to calculate Poisson Probability Mass Function (PMF)
def poisson_pmf(k, lambda_):
    return (lambda_ ** k * math.exp(-lambda_)) / math.factorial(k)

# Function to calculate Poisson Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
def poisson_cdf(k, lambda_):
    cdf_value = 0
    for i in range(k + 1):
        cdf_value += poisson_pmf(i, lambda_)
    return cdf_value

# Parameters
lambda_ = 4  # Average number of people visiting the market per time period

# Calculate the probability of more than 5 people visiting the market
probability_more_than_5 = 1 - poisson_cdf(5, lambda_)

print(f"The probability of more than 5 people visiting the market is: {probability_more_than_5:.4f}")

```

# ðŸŽ¯ **Summary of Key Concepts**

## ðŸ“Œ **Poisson Distribution:**

- **Modeling Event Count**: Used to model the count of events happening in a fixed interval of time or space.

### **Formula:**

$$
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

- **Mean and Variance**: Both are equal to \( \lambda \).
- **Standard Deviation**: \( \sqrt{\lambda} \).

# ðŸŽ¯ **Key Takeaways**

âœ” **Poisson distribution** is useful for modeling counts of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.  
âœ” The **mean** and **variance** of the distribution are both equal to \( \lambda \).  
âœ” The **Python code** computes the probability of more than a certain number of events occurring, such as the number of people visiting a market.

---

# ðŸš€ **Conclusion**

The **Poisson distribution** is an excellent tool for handling scenarios where events occur randomly and independently within a fixed interval. It's widely used in real-world applications like traffic flow, market analysis, and queuing theory. With the formulas and Python code above, you can apply this distribution to model and solve similar problems!
