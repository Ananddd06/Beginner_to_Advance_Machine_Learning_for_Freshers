# 🎲 **Binomial Distribution: Understanding and Application** 📊

## 🔹 **Introduction to Binomial Distribution**

The **Binomial Distribution** is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a fixed number of trials of a binary (yes/no) experiment. Each trial has only two outcomes: success or failure. It's commonly used in quality control, survey sampling, and other cases where you're counting the number of successes out of multiple trials.

### **Key Characteristics of Binomial Distribution:**

1. **Fixed number of trials** (e.g., 100 phones in the example).
2. **Each trial is independent** (the outcome of one trial doesn’t affect others).
3. **Two possible outcomes per trial**: success or failure.
4. **Constant probability of success** (denoted as **p**) in each trial.

## 🎯 **The Binomial Distribution Formula**

The probability of having exactly **k** successes in **n** trials, where each trial has a probability **p** of success and a probability **1-p** of failure, is given by the **Binomial Distribution Formula**:

$$
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}
$$

Where:

- \( P(X = k) \) = Probability of having exactly **k** successes (defective phones).
- \( n \) = Total number of trials (in our case, **100 phones**).
- \( k \) = Number of defective phones you're interested in (e.g., **3 defective phones**).
- \( p \) = Probability of success (the probability of a defective phone, e.g., **0.05**).
- \( \binom{n}{k} \) = Binomial coefficient, calculated as \( \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \).

## 🎯 **Example: Defective Phones in a Batch of 100**

Let’s consider a phone manufacturing company with **5 categories** of phones, and we want to calculate the probability of finding exactly **3 defective phones** in a batch of **100 phones**.

### Parameters:

- **n = 100** (Total number of phones).
- **k = 3** (Defective phones we are interested in).
- **p = 0.05, 0.1, 0.07, 0.03, 0.06** (Probability of defects in each product category).

We can apply the binomial distribution formula to calculate the probability for each category.

## 🎯 **Statistical Measures of Binomial Distribution**

### 1️⃣ **Mean (Expected Value)**

The **mean** or expected value of a binomial distribution is the average number of successes (defective phones) you expect to observe.

$$
\mu = n \cdot p
$$

- Where:
  - \( \mu \) = mean
  - \( n \) = number of trials
  - \( p \) = probability of success (defective phone)

### 2️⃣ **Variance**

The **variance** of a binomial distribution measures the spread or variability of the number of successes.

$$
\sigma^2 = n \cdot p \cdot (1 - p)
$$

- Where:
  - \( \sigma^2 \) = variance
  - \( n \) = number of trials
  - \( p \) = probability of success (defective phone)
  - \( 1 - p \) = probability of failure

### 3️⃣ **Standard Deviation**

The **standard deviation** is the square root of the variance and represents the average amount by which the actual number of defective phones is expected to vary from the mean.

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{n \cdot p \cdot (1 - p)}
$$

- Where:
  - \( \sigma \) = standard deviation
  - \( n \) = number of trials
  - \( p \) = probability of success (defective phone)

## 🎯 **Visualizing the Distribution**

For **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis), plotting the binomial distribution helps us visualize how likely different numbers of defective phones are in the batch.

## 🎯 **Python Code: Binomial Distribution for Defective Phones**

Here’s the Python code to calculate and visualize the probability of finding exactly 3 defective phones in 100 phones across 5 categories.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import binom

# Parameters
n = 100  # Total number of phones
k = 3    # Number of defective phones you're interested in
categories = ['Product A', 'Product B', 'Product C', 'Product D', 'Product E']
defect_probabilities = [0.05, 0.1, 0.07, 0.03, 0.06]  # Defect probabilities for each product category

# Calculate the probability of finding 'k' defective phones for each category
probabilities = []

for p in defect_probabilities:
    prob = binom.pmf(k, n, p)  # Binomial PMF (Probability Mass Function)
    probabilities.append(prob)

# Print the results
for category, prob in zip(categories, probabilities):
    print(f"Probability of {k} defective phones in {category}: {prob:.4f}")

# Visualize the binomial distribution for each product category
x = np.arange(0, n + 1)  # Possible values of defective phones (0 to 100)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

for category, p in zip(categories, defect_probabilities):
    y = binom.pmf(x, n, p)
    plt.plot(x, y, label=category)

plt.title('Binomial Distribution for Defective Phones in 5 Categories')
plt.xlabel('Number of Defective Phones')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

```

## 🎯 **Summary of Key Formulas**

| Measure           | Formula                                       | Description                         |

## 🚀 **Takeaway**

- The binomial distribution is a powerful tool for understanding the probability of a certain number of successes (defective phones) in a given set of trials (phone batches). By calculating the **mean**, **variance**, and **standard deviation**, we gain valuable insights into the distribution of defects in the phones.

- Now, you can easily apply this knowledge to **quality control** and **risk management** in manufacturing! 📈🔍
