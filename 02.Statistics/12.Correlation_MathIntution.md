# 📊 Pearson Correlation Coefficient - Intuition and Formula

## ✅ Definition

The **Pearson correlation coefficient (r)** measures the **linear relationship** between two continuous variables.

It ranges from:

- **+1** → Perfect positive linear correlation
- ** 0** → No linear correlation
- **–1** → Perfect negative linear correlation

---

## 🔣 Formula

$$
r = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

Where:

- \(x_i, y_i\) are the individual data points
- \(\bar{x}, \bar{y}\) are the means of x and y

## 🔍 Intuition Behind the Formula

### 🔸 Numerator: Co-Movement

$$
\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})
$$

This term tells us how **x and y move together**:

- If both are above or both below their means → product is **positive** → contributes to **positive correlation**
- If one is above and the other below → product is **negative** → contributes to **negative correlation**

✅ Thus, the numerator captures the **direction and strength** of co-movement.

### 🔸 Denominator: Normalization

$$
\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$

- This part is the product of the **standard deviations** of x and y
- It **scales** the numerator to fall in the range **[-1, +1]**
- Makes the correlation **unitless** and **comparable** across datasets

---

## ✅ Final Interpretation

> The **Pearson correlation coefficient** tells us how strongly two variables **move together**, and whether that relationship is **positive or negative**.  
> It is scaled to the range **[-1, 1]**, where:

- `+1` means strong positive correlation,
- `0` means no linear relationship,
- `–1` means strong negative correlation.

---

## 💡 Summary (In Simple Words)

- **Numerator**: Measures if x and y move together (positive) or oppositely (negative)
- **Denominator**: Scales the result using their standard deviations to stay between -1 and 1
