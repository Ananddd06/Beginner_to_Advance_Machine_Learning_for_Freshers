# 🌟 Understanding Percentage, Percentile, Quantiles, and Quartiles 📊

## 📊 **What is Percentage?**

A **percentage** is a way to express **how much** something is relative to a total, typically out of **100**. It allows us to compare different quantities in a standardized way. 🔢

### Formula:

### Example:

If you scored **80 out of 100** in a test, the percentage would be:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{80}{100} \right) \times 100 = 80\%
\]
This means you achieved **80%** of the total possible score. 🎯

## 📈 **What is Percentile?**

A **percentile** is a measure used to understand **how a value compares to the rest of the data**. It indicates the **percentage of data points that are below a specific value**.

### Formula to Calculate Percentile:

\[
\text{Percentile Rank} = \frac{\text{Percentile Position}}{100} \times n + 1
\]
Where:

- **Percentile Position**: The rank of the data point.
- **n**: The total number of data points.

### Example:

Let’s say you have a list of scores from a test. If your score is at the **80th percentile**, this means you did **better than 80%** of the people who took the test. 🎓

## 📊 **What are Quantiles?**

**Quantiles** divide the data into equal parts. The most common types of quantiles are **quartiles**, which split the data into four equal parts. They give us a better understanding of the distribution of data. 📉

### Common Quantiles:

- **Q1 (First Quartile)**: The **25th percentile**. It marks the **25%** of data below it.
- **Q2 (Second Quartile / Median)**: The **50th percentile**. It divides the data into two equal halves.
- **Q3 (Third Quartile)**: The **75th percentile**. It marks the **75%** of data below it.

These quartiles help in understanding how data is spread. 📊

## 🔍 **5-Number Summary**

The **5-number summary** provides a quick overview of the data set, showing key values to summarize its distribution:

1. **Minimum**: The smallest value in the dataset.
2. **Q1 (First Quartile)**: The **25th percentile**.
3. **Median (Q2)**: The **50th percentile**, dividing the dataset into two equal parts.
4. **Q3 (Third Quartile)**: The **75th percentile**.
5. **Maximum**: The largest value in the dataset.

### Example:

Consider the following data set of numbers:
\[ 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 \]

- **Minimum**: 4
- **Q1**: 8 (25% of data below this point)
- **Median**: 15 (50% of data below this point)
- **Q3**: 23 (75% of data below this point)
- **Maximum**: 42

## 📏 **Interquartile Range (IQR)**

The **Interquartile Range (IQR)** is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). It helps in identifying the spread of the middle 50% of the data. 📉

### Formula:

\[
\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
\]

### Example:

If **Q1 = 8** and **Q3 = 23**, then:
\[
\text{IQR} = 23 - 8 = 15
\]

## ⚖️ **Outlier Detection**

An **outlier** is a data point that is **significantly different** from the rest of the data. To find outliers, we use the **IQR method**.

### Formula for Outliers:

- **Lower Bound**:

Lower Bound = (Q1 - 1.5)\* IQR

- **Upper Bound**:

Upper Bound = (Q3 + 1.5)\* IQR

If any data point is **below the lower bound** or **above the upper bound**, it is considered an **outlier**.

### Example:

If:

- **Q1 = 8**
- **Q3 = 23**
- **IQR = 15**

Then:

- **Lower Bound** = 8 - (1.5 \* 15) = **-2.5**
- **Upper Bound** = 23 + (1.5 \* 15) = **33.5**

Any data point less than **-2.5** or greater than **33.5** would be considered an outlier. 🧐

### Python code for getting the Lower bound , Upperbound and the outliers

- PYTHON

```python
import numpy as np

def percentile(arr, percent):
    """Calculate the percentile using (n+1) method."""
    arr_sorted = sorted(arr)  # Sort the array
    n = len(arr_sorted)
    rank = (percent / 100) * (n + 1)  # Compute rank

    # If rank is an integer, return the value at that index
    if rank.is_integer():
        return arr_sorted[int(rank) - 1]  # -1 for zero-based index

    # If not, interpolate
    lower_idx = int(rank) - 1  # Floor index
    upper_idx = lower_idx + 1  # Next index
    fraction = rank - (lower_idx + 1)  # Decimal part

    if upper_idx >= len(arr_sorted):
        return arr_sorted[lower_idx]  # Edge case

    return arr_sorted[lower_idx] + fraction * (arr_sorted[upper_idx] - arr_sorted[lower_idx])

def calculate_iqr(arr):
    """Calculate the IQR, lower bound, upper bound, and find outliers."""
    Q1 = percentile(arr, 25)  # 25th percentile
    Q3 = percentile(arr, 75)  # 75th percentile
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

    # Finding outliers
    outliers = [x for x in arr if x < lower_bound or x > upper_bound]

    return Q1, Q3, IQR, lower_bound, upper_bound, outliers

# Sample dataset
arr = [2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 30, 45]  # 30 and 45 might be outliers

Q1, Q3, IQR, lower_bound, upper_bound, outliers = calculate_iqr(arr)

print(f"Q1 (25th Percentile): {Q1}")
print(f"Q3 (75th Percentile): {Q3}")
print(f"IQR: {IQR}")
print(f"Lower Bound: {lower_bound}")
print(f"Upper Bound: {upper_bound}")
print(f"Outliers: {outliers}")

```
