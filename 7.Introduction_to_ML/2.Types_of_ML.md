# 🚀 Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is categorized into different types based on **how the model learns from data**. The four main types are:

1. **Supervised Learning** 🏫
2. **Unsupervised Learning** 🎭
3. **Semi-Supervised Learning** 🔗
4. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** 🎮

Let's explore each type in detail!

## 🏫 1. Supervised Learning

**Definition:**  
Supervised Learning is a type of ML where the model is trained on a **labeled dataset** (i.e., input data has corresponding correct outputs). The model learns by mapping inputs to the correct outputs.

**How it Works:**

- The dataset contains **features (X)** and **labels (Y)**.
- The model learns patterns from labeled data.
- After training, the model predicts **Y for new X values**.

**Examples:**  
✅ **Spam Detection** – Classifying emails as "Spam" or "Not Spam"  
✅ **Fraud Detection** – Identifying fraudulent transactions  
✅ **House Price Prediction** – Predicting house prices based on size, location, etc.

**Common Algorithms:**

- 📈 **Linear Regression** (for continuous predictions)
- 🌳 **Decision Trees** (for classification & regression)
- 🤖 **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

## 🎭 2. Unsupervised Learning

**Definition:**  
Unsupervised Learning is a type of ML where the model **does not have labeled data**. Instead, it finds **hidden patterns and structures** in the data.

**How it Works:**

- No labeled output (Y) is provided.
- The model clusters or groups similar data points.
- Used for **pattern discovery and anomaly detection**.

**Examples:**  
🔍 **Customer Segmentation** – Grouping customers based on behavior  
📊 **Anomaly Detection** – Detecting fraudulent transactions  
📷 **Image Compression** – Reducing image size by identifying similar patterns

**Common Algorithms:**

- 🔗 **K-Means Clustering** (for grouping data)
- 🕵️ **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** (for dimensionality reduction)
- 🌍 **Hierarchical Clustering**

## 🔗 3. Semi-Supervised Learning

**Definition:**  
Semi-Supervised Learning is a mix of **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**. It uses a **small amount of labeled data** and a **large amount of unlabeled data** to improve learning.

**How it Works:**

- The labeled data helps the model learn initial patterns.
- The model then applies these patterns to **unlabeled data** to improve accuracy.
- Common in cases where **labeling data is expensive or difficult**.

**Examples:**  
🩺 **Medical Diagnosis** – Using few labeled patient records to classify diseases  
📜 **Text Classification** – Categorizing large text datasets with limited labeled samples  
🔍 **Web Page Ranking** – Search engines learning from both labeled and unlabeled user interactions

**Common Algorithms:**

- 🔄 **Self-training** (iteratively labeling new data)
- 🧠 **Graph-based models** (e.g., Label Propagation)

---

## 🎮 4. Reinforcement Learning (RL)

**Definition:**  
Reinforcement Learning is a type of ML where an **agent learns by interacting with an environment** and receiving **rewards or penalties** based on actions.

**How it Works:**

- The agent takes an **action** in an environment.
- The environment provides **feedback** (reward or penalty).
- The agent learns by maximizing rewards over time.

**Examples:**  
🤖 **Robotics** – Teaching robots to walk, grasp objects  
🚗 **Self-Driving Cars** – Learning to navigate roads by trial and error  
🎮 **Game AI** – AI mastering chess, Go, or video games (e.g., AlphaGo)

**Common Algorithms:**

- 🏆 **Q-Learning** (basic RL technique)
- 🎭 **Deep Q Networks (DQN)** (used in Deep RL)
- 🧠 **Policy Gradient Methods** (for advanced decision-making)
