# 📏 Equation of a Line in 2D, 3D, and N-Dimensional Space

A line or plane in different dimensions can be represented using mathematical equations. Below, we explore **2D, 3D, and N-Dimensional equations** with proper formulas.

---

## ✏️ 1. Equation of a Line in **2D**

In **2D space**, the equation of a straight line is:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

where:

- \( y \) = dependent variable (output)
- \( x \) = independent variable (input)
- \( m \) = slope of the line
- \( c \) = y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)

### 📌 Special Case (Passing Through Origin):

If the line passes through **(0,0)**, then the intercept \( c = 0 \), so the equation simplifies to:

$$
y = mx
$$

## 📐 2. Equation of a Line in **3D**

In **3D space**, a line cannot be represented using a simple equation like in 2D. Instead, it is represented using **parametric equations**:

$$
x = x_0 + at
$$

$$
y = y_0 + bt
$$

$$
z = z_0 + ct
$$

where:

- \( (x_0, y_0, z_0) \) = a point on the line
- \( (a, b, c) \) = direction vector of the line
- \( t \) = parameter that varies along the line

Alternatively, using vector form:

$$
\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r_0} + t \mathbf{d}
$$

where:

- \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) (any point on the line)
- \( \mathbf{r_0} = (x_0, y_0, z_0) \) (initial point)
- \( \mathbf{d} = (a, b, c) \) (direction vector)

## 🏗️ 3. Equation of a Plane in **3D**

A **plane** in 3D space is represented as:

$$
ax + by + cz + d = 0
$$

where:

- \( (a, b, c) \) = normal vector (perpendicular to the plane)
- \( d \) = constant that determines the plane’s position

If the plane **passes through the origin (0,0,0)**, then \( d = 0 \), so the equation simplifies to:

$$
ax + by + cz = 0
$$

---

## 🌍 4. General Equation in **N-Dimensional Space**

For an **N-dimensional hyperplane**, the equation is written as:

$$
w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + \dots + w_nx_n + b = 0
$$

Or, in vector form:

$$
\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X} + b = 0
$$

where:

- \( \mathbf{W} = (w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n) \) is the **weight (normal) vector**
- \( \mathbf{X} = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \) is the **input vector**
- \( b \) = bias (intercept)

### 📌 Special Case (Passing Through Origin):

If the plane passes through the **origin (0,0,…,0)**, then \( b = 0 \), so the equation simplifies to:

$$
\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X} = 0
$$

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

- **2D Line**: \( y = mx + c \) (intercept \( c \) disappears if passing through origin)
- **3D Line**: Uses **parametric equations**
- **3D Plane**: \( ax + by + cz + d = 0 \)
- **N-Dimensional Plane**: \( \mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X} + b = 0 \)

🚀 _These equations are fundamental in geometry, physics, and machine learning (e.g., hyperplanes in SVMs)!_
