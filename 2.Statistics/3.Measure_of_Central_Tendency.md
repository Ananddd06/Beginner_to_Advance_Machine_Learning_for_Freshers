# Understanding Mean, Median, and Mode in Machine Learning

Hello there! 👋 Let's explore some cool ways to understand numbers using **mean**, **median**, and **mode**. These are tools that help us make sense of lots of numbers. You’ll learn what each one does, and I promise, by the end, it will be super easy to understand! 😊

## 1. Mean (Average) 🧮

### What is it?

The **mean** is the average. It tells us what the "typical" value is when we have a group of numbers. It's like when you ask a class what their favorite color is, and most of them say blue—blue is the "average" favorite color.

### How do we calculate it?

1. **Add** all the numbers together.
2. **Divide** that sum by how many numbers there are.

### Formula:

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all numbers}}{\text{Number of values}}
$$

#### Example:

If we have the numbers: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5**.

- First, **add** them: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = **15**.
- Then, **divide** by the number of numbers: 15 ÷ 5 = **3**.

So, the mean (or average) is **3**.

## 2. Median (Middle Value) 🎯

### What is it?

The **median** is the middle value. Imagine you have 5 friends in a line, and they all have different heights. The median is the height of the person who is standing right in the middle!

### Why is it special?

The median is great when we have **outliers**—numbers that are way bigger or way smaller than the others. The median helps because it ignores those weird outliers and focuses on what’s in the middle.

### How do we calculate it?

1. **Arrange** the numbers in order from smallest to largest.
2. If the number of values is odd, **pick the middle one**.
3. If it's even, **average the two middle numbers**.

#### Example:

Let’s look at two different sets of numbers.

- **Example 1:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

  - Arrange them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - The middle number is **3**. So, the **median** is **3**.

- **Example 2:** 1, 2, 100, 200, 3

  - Arrange them: 1, 2, 3, 100, 200.
  - Here, **100** and **3** are really big and small numbers (outliers), but the middle number is still **3**. So, the **median** is **3**—it’s like ignoring the weird numbers and just looking at the center.

### Why is the median important?

The **median** is better than the mean when we have **outliers**. In Example 2, the mean would be much higher because of the big numbers (100 and 200), but the median gives us a much more reasonable number.

## 3. Mode (Most Frequent Number) 🔁

### What is it?

The **mode** is the number that appears the most. It’s like asking a group of kids, “What’s your favorite ice cream flavor?” If most of them say chocolate, then **chocolate** is the mode! 🍫

### How do we calculate it?

- Count how many times each number appears.
- The number that appears the most is the **mode**.

#### Example:

For the numbers: **1, 2, 2, 3, 4**.

- **2** appears the most times (2 times), so the **mode** is **2**.

## Why Do We Use Mean, Median, and Mode? 🤔

- **Mean** helps when we want to know the "average" value, like what’s typical in a group of numbers.
- **Median** is helpful when we have **outliers** (numbers that are way too high or low). The median helps us find the true middle number without being thrown off by the outliers.
- **Mode** tells us which number happens the most, helping us understand what’s most common.

## Python Code to Calculate Mean, Median, and Mode (using HashMap for Mode):

````python
import statistics

# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Calculate Mean
mean_value = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
print("Mean:", mean_value)

# Calculate Median
median_value = statistics.median(numbers)
print("Median:", median_value)

- Python

```python
# Calculate Mode using HashMap
def find_mode(nums):
    # Create a dictionary to store frequency of each element
    frequency_map = {}

    # Count the frequency of each element
    for num in nums:
        if num in frequency_map:
            frequency_map[num] += 1
        else:
            frequency_map[num] = 1

    # Find the element with the highest frequency
    mode = max(frequency_map, key=frequency_map.get)

    return mode

mode_value = find_mode(numbers)
print("Mode:", mode_value)
