# ðŸ“Š Guide to Parametric, Non-Parametric, and Categorical Variable Tests

This guide provides a comprehensive understanding of various types of statistical significance tests, categorized into Parametric, Non-Parametric, and Categorical tests. These are commonly used in hypothesis testing, experimental design, and data analysis in machine learning, healthcare, marketing, A/B testing, and more.

## ðŸ”¹ A. Parametric Tests

Parametric tests assume that the data follows a known distribution, typically the **normal distribution**. They are powerful when assumptions hold true but may mislead when assumptions are violated.

### 1. **t-test**

- **Use Case**: Compare means of two independent groups
- **Example**: Exam scores of males vs. females
- **Assumptions**:

  - Normal distribution
  - Equal variances (for Student's t-test)
  - Independent observations

- **Variants**:

  - Student's t-test (equal variance)
  - Welch's t-test (unequal variance)

### 2. **Paired t-test**

- **Use Case**: Compare means from the **same group** at two time points
- **Example**: Weight before and after a diet program
- **Assumptions**:

  - Differences are normally distributed
  - Same subjects in both samples

### 3. **Z-test**

- **Use Case**: Compare means when sample size is large (n > 30) or population variance is known
- **Example**: Checking if the sample mean significantly differs from the population mean
- **Assumptions**:

  - Normal distribution
  - Known variance or large n

### 4. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**

- **Use Case**: Compare means of **three or more** groups
- **Example**: Test scores across three different teaching methods
- **Assumptions**:

  - Normal distribution
  - Homogeneity of variances
  - Independent observations

## ðŸ”¹ B. Non-Parametric Tests

Non-parametric tests **do not assume any specific distribution**. These are useful for ordinal data, non-normal data, or when assumptions for parametric tests are violated.

### 1. **Mann-Whitney U Test**

- **Use Case**: Non-parametric equivalent of the independent t-test
- **Example**: Satisfaction scores from two different services
- **Assumptions**:

  - Independent samples
  - Ordinal or continuous data

### 2. **Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test**

- **Use Case**: Paired sample test (non-parametric)
- **Example**: Blood pressure before and after medication
- **Assumptions**:

  - Symmetrical distribution of differences
  - Paired observations

### 3. **Kruskal-Wallis Test**

- **Use Case**: Non-parametric equivalent of ANOVA
- **Example**: Comparing medians across more than two groups
- **Assumptions**:

  - Independent samples
  - Ordinal or continuous data

### 4. **Permutation Test**

- **Use Case**: Used in A/B testing, compares test statistic under all/random permutations
- **Example**: Click-through rates of two different website versions
- **Method**:

  - Shuffle group labels many times
  - Recalculate test statistic each time
  - Estimate p-value based on how extreme observed value is

### 5. **Bootstrap Test**

- **Use Case**: Estimating confidence intervals or test statistics via resampling with replacement
- **Example**: Estimating mean salary with confidence bounds
- **Method**:

  - Resample data many times (with replacement)
  - Compute statistic for each resample
  - Build distribution and derive CI or p-value

## ðŸ”¹ C. Categorical Variable Tests

Used when the variables involved are **categorical** (e.g., yes/no, male/female).

### 1. **Chi-square Test of Independence**

- **Use Case**: Test for association between two categorical variables
- **Example**: Relationship between gender and purchase behavior
- **Assumptions**:

  - Expected frequencies > 5 in each cell (for large samples)

- **Method**:

  - Construct a contingency table
  - Calculate chi-square statistic
  - Compare to chi-square distribution to get p-value

### 2. **Fisher's Exact Test**

- **Use Case**: Alternative to Chi-square for small sample sizes
- **Example**: Drug efficacy (yes/no) vs. disease presence (yes/no) with < 20 samples
- **Assumptions**:

  - Applicable to 2x2 tables
  - No minimum cell frequency needed

### 3. **Proportion Z-Test**

- **Use Case**: Test difference in proportions between two groups
- **Example**: Proportion of clicks from two different ads
- **Assumptions**:

  - Normal approximation holds (np > 5)

- **Method**:

  - Compare the observed difference in proportions
  - Use z-distribution to get p-value

## ðŸ“Œ Why This Matters in Practice

Understanding which test to use ensures:

- âœ… Proper conclusions from experiments and studies
- âœ… Avoiding Type I and Type II errors
- âœ… Building trust in product/ML feature impact
- âœ… Proper reporting in research papers and A/B tests

Use this as your go-to reference before running significance tests!
