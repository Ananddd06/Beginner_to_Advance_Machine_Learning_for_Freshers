# 📊 Z-Test Deep Dive with Intuition and Problems

## 🧠 What is a Z-Test?

A **Z-test** is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant difference between sample and population means when:

- The population standard deviation is **known** (or sample size is large `n > 30` and we approximate).
- The data is **normally distributed** or the sample is large (Central Limit Theorem).

Z-tests are commonly used to:

- Test the population mean
- Compare two means (independent samples)
- Compare sample proportion with population proportion

## 🧪 Z-Test Formula

The Z-score is calculated as:

$$
z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$

Where:

- $\bar{x}$: Sample mean
- $\mu$: Population mean
- $\sigma$: Population standard deviation (or estimated from large sample)
- $n$: Sample size

## ✅ Hypothesis Testing Steps

1. **Set Hypotheses:**

   - Null Hypothesis $H_0$: No effect / no difference (e.g., $\mu = \mu_0$)
   - Alternative Hypothesis $H_1$: There is a significant effect (e.g., $\mu \ne \mu_0$)

2. **Select significance level:**

   - Usually $\alpha = 0.05$

3. **Calculate Z-Statistic:**

4. **Get p-value from Z-table**

   - Refer: [Standard Normal Table](https://math.arizona.edu/~rsims/ma464/standardnormaltable.pdf)

5. **Decision Rule:**

   - If $p < \alpha$: Reject $H_0$
   - Else: Fail to reject $H_0$

## 📘 Problem-Based Intuition (From Basic to Advanced)

### 🔹 Problem 1: Mean Test for a Factory

A battery company claims that their batteries last 100 hours. A sample of 36 batteries shows a mean of 98 hours with a standard deviation of 6 hours. At 5% significance level, test the claim.

**Given:**

- $\mu = 100$
- $\bar{x} = 98$
- $\sigma = 6$
- $n = 36$

**Z-stat:**

$$
z = \frac{98 - 100}{6 / \sqrt{36}} = \frac{-2}{1} = -2.0
$$

**From Z-table:** $p = 0.0455$

- Since $p < 0.05$, **Reject** $H_0$

🔍 The batteries last **less** than claimed.

### 🔹 Problem 2: Quality Check for Machines

A machine is set to produce screws of 5 cm. From a sample of 50 screws, the mean length is 5.1 cm with population std dev 0.2 cm. Check if the machine is operating correctly at 1% significance.

**Z-stat:**

$$
z = \frac{5.1 - 5}{0.2 / \sqrt{50}} = \frac{0.1}{0.02828} \approx 3.54
$$

**From Z-table:** $p < 0.01$

- **Reject** $H_0$
- The machine **is not** producing correct lengths.

### 🔹 Problem 3: Online Store Delivery Time

The company claims its average delivery time is 2 days. From 49 deliveries, the average is 2.2 days with $\sigma = 0.5$. At 5% significance, is the delivery slower?

**Z-stat:**

$$
z = \frac{2.2 - 2}{0.5 / \sqrt{49}} = \frac{0.2}{0.0714} = 2.8
$$

**From Z-table:** $p = 0.0026$

- $p < 0.05$ → **Reject** $H_0$

Conclusion: Delivery is **significantly slower** than claimed.

### 🔹 Problem 4: Drug Effectiveness Study

A pharmaceutical company tests a new drug. Standard recovery time from flu is 6.5 days. A sample of 64 patients using the new drug shows a mean recovery time of 6.1 days, $\sigma = 1.6$.

**Z-stat:**

$$
z = \frac{6.1 - 6.5}{1.6 / \sqrt{64}} = \frac{-0.4}{0.2} = -2.0
$$

**From Z-table:** $p = 0.0455$

- $p < 0.05$ → **Reject** $H_0$

✔️ Drug **significantly reduces** recovery time.

### 🔹 Problem 5: Website Conversion Rate

The old version of a website has a 10% conversion rate. A new design is tested on 1000 visitors and shows a 12% conversion rate. Can we say the new version performs better at 1% level?

Here, this is a **proportion z-test**:

$$
z = \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{p(1 - p)/n}} = \frac{0.12 - 0.10}{\sqrt{0.10(0.90)/1000}} = \frac{0.02}{0.00949} \approx 2.11
$$

**Z-stat ≈ 2.11** → $p \approx 0.0174$

- $p > 0.01$, so **Fail to reject** $H_0$

🔍 The improvement is not significant at 1%, but it would be at 5%.

---

## 📌 Summary

- Use Z-test when $n > 30$ and population std dev is known or approximated.
- Use T-test otherwise.
- P-value gives the **strength of evidence**.
- Always compare $p$ with $\alpha$ to make a decision.
