## üß™ Hypothesis Testing (Deep Dive)

### üîç What is Hypothesis Testing?

A **framework to make decisions** or inferences about a population using sample data. It answers: "Is what we observed just due to chance, or is it statistically significant?"

### üéØ Core Concepts

| Term                            | Meaning                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**        | The default claim (e.g., coin is fair, no difference)                        |
| **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)** | The opposing claim (e.g., coin is biased)                                    |
| **Test Statistic**              | Summary of data used to decide whether to reject H‚ÇÄ                          |
| **p-value**                     | Probability of getting a result as extreme as the observed one if H‚ÇÄ is true |
| **Significance Level (Œ±)**      | Threshold for rejecting H‚ÇÄ (commonly 0.05)                                   |
| **Type I Error (Œ±)**            | Rejecting H‚ÇÄ when it's true (false positive)                                 |
| **Type II Error (Œ≤)**           | Failing to reject H‚ÇÄ when it's false (false negative)                        |
| **Power (1‚àíŒ≤)**                 | Probability of correctly rejecting a false H‚ÇÄ                                |

### üî¢ General Steps

1. **Define hypotheses:** H‚ÇÄ and H‚ÇÅ
2. **Choose significance level (Œ±)**: Typically 0.05
3. **Choose test** (Z, t, œá¬≤, etc.)
4. **Compute test statistic**
5. **Compare with critical value** or calculate p-value
6. **Make decision**: Reject or fail to reject H‚ÇÄ

## üß† Test Types & Formulas

### üîπ 1. Z-Test

Use when:

- Sample size is large (n > 30)
- Population standard deviation (œÉ) is known

$Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$

### üîπ 2. t-Test

Use when:

- Sample size is small (n ‚â§ 30)
- Population standard deviation is unknown

$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}$

---

### üîπ 3. Welch‚Äôs t-test

Use when:

- Comparing two means with **unequal variances** and **unequal sample sizes**

$t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$

- Degrees of freedom (approx.):
  $df = \frac{(s_1^2/n_1 + s_2^2/n_2)^2}{\frac{(s_1^2/n_1)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \frac{(s_2^2/n_2)^2}{n_2 - 1}}$

**Why:** More robust when the assumption of equal variances is violated.

---

### üîπ 4. Paired t-test

Use when:

- You have **paired observations** (e.g., before and after)

$t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}$

- $\bar{d}$: mean of differences
- $s_d$: std dev of differences

**Why:** Controls individual variability by focusing on differences.

---

### üîπ 5. Mann-Whitney U Test

Use when:

- Comparing two **independent** samples
- **Data is not normally distributed**

**Why:** Non-parametric test that compares ranks rather than values.

- Does **not** assume normality

---

### üîπ 6. Kruskal-Wallis H Test

Use when:

- Comparing **3+ independent groups**
- Data is **non-normal**

**Why:** Non-parametric alternative to ANOVA

- Uses rank-based method

---

### üîπ 7. Bayesian Hypothesis Testing

Use when:

- You want to calculate probability of hypotheses given data

**Bayes Factor (BF):**
$BF = \frac{P(D | H_1)}{P(D | H_0)}$

- D = data, H‚ÇÄ = null, H‚ÇÅ = alternate
- **BF > 1** ‚Üí more evidence for H‚ÇÅ

**Why:** Provides **probabilistic interpretation**, more intuitive in practice

---

### üîπ 8. Permutation Test

Use when:

- You have **no distributional assumptions**
- Need a flexible test based on **resampling**

**Why:** Powerful non-parametric method to assess significance

---

### üîπ 9. Log-Rank Test (Survival Analysis)

Use when:

- Comparing **time-to-event** data between groups

**Why:** Tests if survival distributions are significantly different

- Common in **churn** or **retention analysis**
