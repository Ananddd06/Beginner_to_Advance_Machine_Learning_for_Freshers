# 📊 Introduction to Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics is the branch of statistics that helps us **make predictions, decisions, or generalizations** about a population based on a **sample of data**. Unlike descriptive statistics which summarizes data, inferential statistics allows us to draw **conclusions beyond the immediate data alone**.

## 🔍 Why Use Inferential Statistics?

- To estimate **population parameters** from sample data
- To test **hypotheses** and validate assumptions
- To compare **groups or treatments**
- To assess **relationships** between variables

## 🧪 Common Inferential Statistical Tests

Here’s a categorized list of essential inferential tests:

### ✅ 1. **Z-Test**

- **Use When**: Population standard deviation (σ) is known
- **Types**:

  - One-sample Z-test
  - Two-sample Z-test

- **Application**: Compare sample mean to population mean

### ✅ 2. **T-Test**

- **Use When**: Population standard deviation is unknown
- **Types**:

  - One-sample t-test
  - Two-sample t-test (independent samples)
  - Paired t-test (dependent samples)

- **Application**: Testing mean differences

### ✅ 3. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**

- **Use When**: Comparing more than 2 group means
- **Types**:

  - One-way ANOVA
  - Two-way ANOVA

- **Application**: Test group mean differences

### ✅ 4. **Chi-Square (χ²) Test**

- **Use When**: Variables are categorical
- **Types**:

  - Chi-square test for independence
  - Chi-square goodness-of-fit test

- **Application**: Testing relationships and distributions of categorical data

### ✅ 5. **F-Test**

- **Use When**: Comparing variances of two populations
- **Application**: Often used in ANOVA

### ✅ 6. **P-Value**

- Represents the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct.
- **Rule**: If p-value < significance level (α, usually 0.05), **reject H₀**

### ✅ 7. **Confidence Intervals (CI)**

- A range of values used to estimate the true value of a population parameter
- **Formula for Mean** (σ unknown):

  $$
  CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$

### ✅ 8. **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**

- Non-parametric method using resampling
- **Algorithm**:

  1. Draw resamples from the original sample with replacement
  2. Compute statistic of interest for each resample
  3. Repeat R times
  4. Take percentiles (e.g., 2.5% and 97.5%) for 95% CI

### ✅ 9. **Z-Test vs T-Test Decision Chart**

```markdown
| Condition                       | Use    |
| ------------------------------- | ------ |
| σ known and n large (≥ 30)      | Z-Test |
| σ unknown and/or n small (< 30) | T-Test |
```

## 🧠 Hypothesis Testing Framework

1. **Form Hypotheses**

   - H₀: Null Hypothesis (no effect)
   - H₁: Alternative Hypothesis (effect exists)

2. **Choose Significance Level (α)**

   - Common values: 0.05, 0.01

3. **Calculate Test Statistic**

4. **Find p-value or critical value**

5. **Make Decision**

   - If p-value < α → ❌ Reject H₀
   - If p-value ≥ α → ✅ Fail to reject H₀

---

## 🤔 What Does "Rejecting H₀" Mean?

- Data provides **strong enough evidence** against the null
- Suggests the effect is **statistically significant**

## ❓ What If We Fail to Reject H₀?

- Not enough evidence to support a difference or effect
- Doesn’t mean H₀ is true — just **not enough proof** to reject it

---

## 📚 Summary

Inferential statistics enables us to:

- Generalize results from samples
- Assess statistical significance
- Make decisions using data

It’s foundational to **machine learning**, **data science**, and **scientific research**.
