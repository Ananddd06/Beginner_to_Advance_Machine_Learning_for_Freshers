# 📊 Student's T-Test Deep Dive with Intuition and Problems

## 🧠 What is a T-Test?

A **T-test** is a statistical test used to compare the means of groups when the sample size is small (typically $n < 30$) and the population standard deviation is **unknown**.

T-tests are used in three primary scenarios:

- One-sample t-test: Compare a sample mean to a known value.
- Two-sample t-test: Compare means of two independent groups.
- Paired t-test: Compare means from the same group at different times (dependent samples).

## 🧪 T-Test Formula

### One-Sample T-Test:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
$$

Where:

- $\bar{x}$: Sample mean
- $\mu$: Population mean
- $s$: Sample standard deviation
- $n$: Sample size

Use the [T-distribution table](https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/t-table.pdf) to determine critical values or p-values based on degrees of freedom ($df = n - 1$).

## ✅ Hypothesis Testing Steps

1. **Set Hypotheses:**

   - Null Hypothesis $H_0$: $\mu = \mu_0$
   - Alternative Hypothesis $H_1$: $\mu \ne \mu_0$ (two-tailed), or $\mu > \mu_0$ (right-tailed), $\mu < \mu_0$ (left-tailed)

2. **Choose significance level:**

   - Common choices: $\alpha = 0.05$, $0.01$

3. **Compute the test statistic (t-value)**

4. **Find p-value from t-table**

5. **Make decision:**

   - If $p < \alpha$: Reject $H_0$
   - Else: Fail to reject $H_0$

## 📈 Tail Types in T-Test

- **Two-tailed test**: Testing whether the sample mean is significantly **different** (either higher or lower) from the population mean.
- **Left-tailed test**: Testing if the sample mean is **less** than the population mean.
- **Right-tailed test**: Testing if the sample mean is **greater** than the population mean.

## 📘 Problem-Based Intuition (From Basic to Advanced)

### 🔹 Problem 1: 🍎 Quality Check on Apple Weights (Two-Tailed)

A farmer claims his apples weigh 200g on average. A sample of 10 apples has a mean weight of 192g and standard deviation of 12g. Test the claim at $\alpha = 0.05$.

**Given:**

- $\mu = 200$
- $\bar{x} = 192$
- $s = 12$
- $n = 10$, $df = 9$

**T-statistic:**

$$
t = \frac{192 - 200}{12 / \sqrt{10}} = \frac{-8}{3.79} = -2.11
$$

**From t-table:** At $df = 9$, $t_{0.05} \approx 2.262$

- $|t| = 2.11 < 2.262$ → **Fail to reject** $H_0$

✔️ No significant evidence apples weigh less.

### 🔹 Problem 2: 🧪 Drug Testing (Left-Tailed)

A new drug claims to reduce blood pressure. Normal BP is 120 mmHg. A sample of 8 patients on the drug has a mean BP of 114 with standard deviation of 6. Use $\alpha = 0.01$.

**T-statistic:**

$$
t = \frac{114 - 120}{6 / \sqrt{8}} = \frac{-6}{2.12} = -2.83
$$

**Degrees of freedom:** $df = 7$, critical $t_{0.01} \approx 2.998$

- $|t| = 2.83 < 2.998$ → **Fail to reject** $H_0$

📉 Not enough evidence at 1% level.

---

### 🔹 Problem 3: 🧑‍🎓 Students’ Test Scores (Right-Tailed)

You want to know if a new teaching method improves math scores. Average score is 70. From 16 students taught using the method, the mean score is 75, $s = 8$. $\alpha = 0.05$

**T-statistic:**

$$
t = \frac{75 - 70}{8 / \sqrt{16}} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5
$$

**df = 15** → $t_{0.05} = 2.131$

- $t = 2.5 > 2.131$ → **Reject** $H_0$

✅ Teaching method is effective.

### 🔹 Problem 4: 🧠 Brain Reaction Times (Left-Tailed)

In a psychology experiment, reaction times (in ms) are measured. The population mean is 250 ms. A new training method is tested on 25 people; they average 240 ms, $s = 10$. Is there an improvement?

**T-statistic:**

$$
t = \frac{240 - 250}{10 / \sqrt{25}} = \frac{-10}{2} = -5.0
$$

**df = 24**, $t_{0.01} \approx 2.797$

- $|t| = 5.0 > 2.797$ → **Reject** $H_0$

✅ Reaction time significantly improved.

### 🔹 Problem 5: 📈 Manufacturing Defect Time (Two-Tailed)

Machine standard downtime is 12 mins. A sample of 5 shifts gives: \[14, 13, 10, 12, 11]. Is the downtime significantly different?

**Sample mean:** $\bar{x} = 12$, $s = 1.58$

$$
t = \frac{12 - 12}{1.58 / \sqrt{5}} = \frac{0}{0.707} = 0
$$

**df = 4** → Any critical value is $> 0$
→ **Fail to reject** $H_0$

🔍 Downtime matches the standard.

## 📌 Summary

- Use T-test when $n < 30$ or population std deviation is unknown.
- Choose the right form: one-sample, two-sample, or paired.
- Specify left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed based on hypothesis direction.
- Degrees of freedom: $df = n - 1$
- Check t-table values here: [T Table PDF](https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/t-table.pdf)
