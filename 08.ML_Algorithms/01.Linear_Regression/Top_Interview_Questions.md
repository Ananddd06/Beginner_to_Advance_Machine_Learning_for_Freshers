**Answer**: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model by splitting the data into training and testing sets multiple times.

---

### 24. **How do you deal with missing values in your dataset?** ❓

**Answer**: Missing values can be handled by imputation (mean, median, mode), removal, or using models that can handle missing data directly.

---

### 25. **What is Homoscedasticity and why is it important in Linear Regression?** 🔄

**Answer**: Homoscedasticity means that the variance of errors remains constant across all levels of the independent variables. It ensures that model predictions are unbiased.

---

### 26. **What is the difference between a parametric and non-parametric model?** 📏

**Answer**: Parametric models assume a specific form for the underlying data distribution (e.g., Linear Regression), while non-parametric models make fewer assumptions about the data (e.g., Decision Trees).

---

### 27. **What is the role of the intercept in a Linear Regression model?** 📏

**Answer**: The intercept represents the predicted value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.

---

### 28. **What is a p-value in the context of Linear Regression?** 📊

**Answer**: The p-value is used to test the null hypothesis and indicates the significance of each predictor variable. A low p-value suggests that the predictor is statistically significant.
