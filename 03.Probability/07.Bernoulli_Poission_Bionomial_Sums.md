# ðŸ“Š Advanced Probability Problems using Bernoulli, Binomial, and Poisson Distributions

This markdown contains **15 advanced, formula-based probability problems** (5 each) using the **Bernoulli**, **Binomial**, and **Poisson** distributions. Each problem is solved using the actual **mathematical formula**, not just logic or simulation.

## âœ… Bernoulli Distribution (5 Advanced Problems)

### ðŸ“Œ Formula:

$P(X = x) = p^x \cdot (1 - p)^{1 - x}$
Where:

- `x` = 0 or 1 (failure/success)
- `p` = probability of success

### ðŸ§ª Problem 1:

A startup runs an experiment where 1 in 4 users sign up for a newsletter. What is the probability that a randomly selected user signs up?

**Solution:**
$P(X=1) = 0.25^1 \cdot (1 - 0.25)^0 = 0.25$

---

### ðŸ§ª Problem 2:

If 90% of servers remain online during a test, what is the probability that a randomly chosen server is offline?

**Solution:**
$P(X=0) = 0.9^0 \cdot (1 - 0.9)^1 = 0.1$

---

### ðŸ§ª Problem 3:

In a fraud detection system, a transaction has a 2% chance of being flagged. Whatâ€™s the chance it isn't flagged?

$P(X=0) = 0.02^0 \cdot 0.98^1 = 0.98$

---

### ðŸ§ª Problem 4:

A robot detects obstacles correctly with a 0.95 probability. Whatâ€™s the probability it correctly detects one obstacle?

$P(X=1) = 0.95^1 \cdot 0.05^0 = 0.95$

---

### ðŸ§ª Problem 5:

A spam filter marks a mail as spam with 60% accuracy. What's the probability it marks a mail incorrectly?

$P(X=0) = 0.6^0 \cdot 0.4^1 = 0.4$

---

## âœ… Binomial Distribution (5 Advanced Problems)

### ðŸ“Œ Formula:

$P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}$
Where:

- `n` = number of trials
- `k` = number of successes
- `p` = probability of success

### ðŸ§ª Problem 1:

An ad has 15% CTR. What's the probability that **3 out of 20** users click it?

$P(X=3) = \binom{20}{3} (0.15)^3 (0.85)^{17}$

---

### ðŸ§ª Problem 2:

A classifier predicts correctly 80% of the time. Whatâ€™s the probability it gets **exactly 7 correct out of 10**?

$P(X=7) = \binom{10}{7} (0.8)^7 (0.2)^3$

---

### ðŸ§ª Problem 3:

Out of 100 visa applicants, the approval rate is 65%. What's the chance exactly 60 get approved?

$P(X=60) = \binom{100}{60} (0.65)^{60} (0.35)^{40}$

---

### ðŸ§ª Problem 4:

If 5% of manufactured phones are defective, what's the probability that **none out of 10** are defective?

$P(X=0) = \binom{10}{0} (0.05)^0 (0.95)^{10} = 0.5987$

---

### ðŸ§ª Problem 5:

A test has a 90% accuracy rate. What's the chance of getting **exactly 8 correct** out of 10?

$P(X=8) = \binom{10}{8} (0.9)^8 (0.1)^2$

---

## âœ… Poisson Distribution (5 Advanced Problems)

### ðŸ“Œ Formula:

$P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$
Where:

- `\lambda` = average rate (events per interval)
- `k` = number of events

### ðŸ§ª Problem 1:

A store gets 5 customers/min. Whatâ€™s the probability exactly 7 customers enter in a minute?

$P(X=7) = \frac{5^7 e^{-5}}{7!}$

---

### ðŸ§ª Problem 2:

A call center receives 3 calls/hour. Whatâ€™s the chance they get no calls in the next hour?

$P(X=0) = \frac{3^0 e^{-3}}{0!} = e^{-3}$

---

### ðŸ§ª Problem 3:

A blog gets 2 comments/hour. Whatâ€™s the probability it receives exactly 4 comments next hour?

$P(X=4) = \frac{2^4 e^{-2}}{4!}$

---

### ðŸ§ª Problem 4:

A server crashes on average 0.5 times/day. Whatâ€™s the probability it crashes **at least once** tomorrow?

$P(X \geq 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \frac{0.5^0 e^{-0.5}}{0!} = 1 - e^{-0.5}$

---

### ðŸ§ª Problem 5:

During an ML training job, you log errors at 6/hour. Whatâ€™s the chance of logging 10 in one hour?

$P(X=10) = \frac{6^{10} e^{-6}}{10!}$
