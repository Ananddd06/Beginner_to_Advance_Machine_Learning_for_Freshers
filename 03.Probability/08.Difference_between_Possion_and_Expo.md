# Understanding Poisson and Exponential Distributions using λ (Lambda)

As a senior applied scientist, it is crucial to understand the mathematical and conceptual relationship between Poisson and Exponential distributions—especially in modeling events that occur over time.

## ✨ Overview

Both the **Poisson** and **Exponential** distributions are fundamental to **stochastic processes**, particularly **Poisson processes**. They are unified by a common parameter: **lambda ($\lambda$)**, which represents the **rate** of events.

- $\lambda$ = average number of events per unit time

---

## ✅ Poisson Distribution

### Definition

The **Poisson distribution** models the **count of events** that occur in a fixed interval of time or space.

### Probability Mass Function (PMF)

$$
P(k; \lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!}
$$

- $k$: number of events
- $\lambda$: average rate of events per interval

### Use Cases

- Number of emails received per hour
- Number of calls arriving at a call center per minute
- Number of earthquakes in a year in a region

### Characteristics

- **Discrete**
- Mean = Variance = $\lambda$
- Events occur **independently**

---

## ⏱ Exponential Distribution

### Definition

The **Exponential distribution** models the **time between two consecutive events** in a Poisson process.

### Probability Density Function (PDF)

$$
f(t; \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}
$$

- $t$: time between events
- $\lambda$: same rate as in Poisson

### Use Cases

- Time until next customer enters a store
- Time between phone calls
- Time until a machine part fails

### Characteristics

- **Continuous**
- Mean = $\frac{1}{\lambda}$
- Memoryless property: $P(T > s + t \mid T > s) = P(T > t)$

## 🧩 Relationship Between the Two

| Aspect           | Poisson Distribution        | Exponential Distribution            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| What it models   | Number of events            | Time between events                 |
| Type             | Discrete                    | Continuous                          |
| Shared parameter | $\lambda$: event rate       | $\lambda$: same rate                |
| Derived from     | Directly models count       | Derived as inter-arrival times      |
| Process          | Event count in fixed window | Waiting time between Poisson events |

**Poisson process** assumption:

- Events occur randomly and independently
- Constant average rate $\lambda$

> In a Poisson process:
>
> - The **number** of events in a time interval follows a **Poisson distribution**.
> - The **time between** these events follows an **Exponential distribution**.

## 📊 Python Visualization Code

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import poisson, expon

# Set the lambda (rate parameter)
lambda_rate = 5  # 5 events per hour

# Poisson Distribution (Discrete)
k_values = np.arange(0, 16)
poisson_probs = poisson.pmf(k_values, mu=lambda_rate)

# Exponential Distribution (Continuous)
t_values = np.linspace(0, 2, 200)
exponential_pdf = expon.pdf(t_values, scale=1/lambda_rate)  # scale = 1/\lambda

# Plotting
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

# Poisson Plot
ax1.bar(k_values, poisson_probs, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
ax1.set_title("Poisson Distribution (\u03bb = 5)")
ax1.set_xlabel("Number of Events (k)")
ax1.set_ylabel("Probability")

# Exponential Plot
ax2.plot(t_values, exponential_pdf, color='green')
ax2.set_title("Exponential Distribution (\u03bb = 5)")
ax2.set_xlabel("Time Between Events (t)")
ax2.set_ylabel("Probability Density")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## 🔄 Summary

- **Poisson Distribution** counts how many events occur.
- **Exponential Distribution** measures the time between events.
- Both are governed by the **same rate $\lambda$** and form the mathematical foundation of **Poisson processes**.

These are **core tools** in ML for **event modeling**, **queueing theory**, **survival analysis**, and **operations research**.

Let me know if you want to extend this with **real-world simulation**, **parameter estimation**, or **application in model training** (e.g., Poisson regression).
