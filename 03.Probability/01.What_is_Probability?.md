# 🎲 Introduction to Probability in Machine Learning

Probability helps us measure **how likely an event is to happen**. It is a key part of machine learning, where models predict the probability of different outcomes.

- If an event is **impossible**, probability = **0** (e.g., rolling a 7 on a 6-sided die 🎲).
- If an event is **certain**, probability = **1** (e.g., rolling a number between 1 and 6 🎲).
- If an event **might happen**, probability is between **0 and 1** (e.g., getting heads on a coin toss = **0.5** 🪙).

## 🎯 **Addition Rule for Probability**

The **Addition Rule** helps us find the probability of **either** one event or another happening.

### ✅ **1. Mutually Exclusive Events**

**Two events are mutually exclusive if they CANNOT happen together.**

**Formula:**

```text
P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B)
```

📌 **Example: Rolling a Die 🎲**

- **A = Rolling a 2 →** Probability = **1/6**
- **B = Rolling a 5 →** Probability = **1/6**
- Since you **cannot** roll a **2 and 5 at the same time**, these events are **mutually exclusive**.

**Solution:**

```text
P(2 OR 5) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3
```

---

### ✅ **2. Non-Mutually Exclusive Events**

**Two events are NOT mutually exclusive if they CAN happen together.**

**Formula:**

```text
P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A AND B)
```

📌 **Example: Drawing a Card 🃏**

- **A = Drawing a Heart →** Probability = **13/52**
- **B = Drawing a Face Card (Jack, Queen, King) →** Probability = **12/52**
- Some cards are **both hearts and face cards** (Jack, Queen, King of Hearts).
  - **P(A AND B) = 3/52**

**Solution:**

```text
P(Heart OR Face Card) = 13/52 + 12/52 - 3/52 = 22/52 = 11/26
```

## 🎯 **Multiplication Rule for Probability**

The **Multiplication Rule** helps us find the probability of **two events happening together**.

### ✅ **1. Independent Events**

**Two events are independent if one does NOT affect the other.**

**Formula:**

```text
P(A AND B) = P(A) × P(B)
```

📌 **Example: Tossing a Coin 🪙 and Rolling a Die 🎲**

- **A = Getting Heads →** Probability = **1/2**
- **B = Rolling a 3 →** Probability = **1/6**
- Coin toss **does not affect** the die roll.

**Solution:**

```text
P(Heads AND 3) = 1/2 × 1/6 = 1/12
```

---

### ✅ **2. Dependent Events**

**Two events are dependent if one event AFFECTS the other.**

**Formula:**

```text
P(A AND B) = P(A) × P(B | A)
```

(Here, `P(B | A)` means **Probability of B happening given A has already happened**.)

📌 **Example: Drawing Two Cards Without Replacement 🃏🃏**

- **A = Drawing an Ace first →** Probability = **4/52**
- **B = Drawing a King second (without replacement) →**
  - After drawing one Ace, **only 51 cards remain**.
  - **Probability of King after Ace = 4/51**

**Solution:**

```text
P(Ace AND King) = 4/52 × 4/51 = 16/2652 = 4/663
```

| Rule Type                                | Formula                               | Example                                                |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Addition (Mutually Exclusive)            | P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B)                | Rolling 2 or 5 on a die → 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3              |
| Addition (Non-Mutually Exclusive)        | P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A AND B)   | Heart or Face Card → 13/52 + 12/52 - 3/52 = 11/26      |
| Multiplication (Independent Events)      | P(A AND B) = P(A) × P(B)               | Heads and Rolling 3 → 1/2 × 1/6 = 1/12                 |
| Multiplication (Dependent Events)        | P(A AND B) = P(A) × P(B | A)           | Ace then King → 4/52 × 4/51 = 4/663                    |

## 🚀 **Why is Probability Important in Machine Learning?**

Machine learning models **predict probabilities** rather than exact outcomes. Examples:  
✅ **Spam Detection** → Probability of an email being spam.  
✅ **Credit Risk** → Probability of a person defaulting on a loan.  
✅ **Medical Diagnosis** → Probability of a disease given symptoms.

Understanding probability is the first step to mastering **Bayesian Statistics**, **Neural Networks**, and **Machine Learning Algorithms**! 🎯
