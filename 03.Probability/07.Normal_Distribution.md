# 📊 Normal Distribution & Z-Score Normalization with Q-Q Plot

## 📘 What is a Normal Distribution?

A **Normal Distribution** (also called **Gaussian distribution**) is a symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution of data where:

- The **mean**, **median**, and **mode** are all equal.
- Most of the data lies **near the mean**.
- It is defined by two parameters:
  - **Mean (μ)**: Center of the distribution
  - **Standard Deviation (σ)**: Spread of the distribution

## ✅ Properties of Normal Distribution

- Symmetrical around the mean
- Total area under the curve = 1
- Follows the **Empirical Rule**:
  - 68% of data within ±1σ
  - 95% within ±2σ
  - 99.7% within ±3σ

## 🧠 What is a Standard Normal Distribution?

A **Standard Normal Distribution** is a special type of normal distribution with:

- **Mean (μ) = 0**
- **Standard Deviation (σ) = 1**

Any normal distribution can be **converted** into a standard normal distribution using **Z-score normalization**.

---

## 🧮 Z-Score Formula

\[
Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

Where:

- `x` = value from the dataset
- `μ` = mean of the feature
- `σ` = standard deviation of the feature

## 🎯 Why Z-Score Normalization?

| Use Case                               | Benefit                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Features with different units/scales   | Makes them comparable                           |
| Distance-based models (e.g., KNN, SVM) | Improves accuracy                               |
| Gradient descent                       | Converges faster                                |
| Outlier detection                      | Helps identify extreme values                   |
| Normality assumption                   | Many models assume data is normally distributed |

## 🛠️ Python Code: Z-Score Normalization

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Sample dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Height_cm': [150, 160, 170, 180, 190],
    'Weight_kg': [50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
})

# Apply Z-score normalization
scaler = StandardScaler()
normalized = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Result as DataFrame
normalized_df = pd.DataFrame(normalized, columns=data.columns)
print(normalized_df)
```

## 🔍 Checking Normality with Q-Q Plot

A **Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) Plot** compares the quantiles of your dataset with the quantiles of a standard normal distribution. If the points lie approximately on the line, your data is **normally distributed**.

---

## 📊 Q-Q Plot using `scipy.stats.probplot`

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats as stats

# Generate normally distributed data
data = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=1000)

# Create Q-Q Plot
stats.probplot(data, dist="norm", plot=plt)
plt.title("Q-Q Plot of Standard Normal Distribution")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

---

## 🔍 Interpretation of Q-Q Plot

| Shape          | Meaning                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Straight line  | Data is normally distributed                |
| S-curve        | Data is skewed                              |
| Heavy tails    | Outliers or non-normal kurtosis             |
| Outlier points | Data values far from expected normal values |

---

## ⚠️ Handling Deviations in Q-Q Plot

If data deviates from the diagonal line:

- ✅ **Check for outliers** (Z-score > 3)
- ✅ **Apply transformations**:
  - **Box-Cox** (for positive values)
  - **Yeo-Johnson** (handles zero/negative values)
- ✅ **Use robust models** (e.g., tree-based) if transformation doesn’t help

---

## 📌 Summary

- Normal Distribution is bell-shaped and symmetrical.
- Standard Normal Distribution has μ=0 and σ=1.
- Z-score normalization transforms your data into standard normal form.
- Use **Q-Q plots** to validate if your data is close to normal.
- If it’s not, try transformation techniques or switch to models that don’t assume normality.
